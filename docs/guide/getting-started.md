## Usage

### Resolving reCAPTCHA V2

1. Import the necessary class to your Python script:

```python
from recaptcha_cracker import RecaptchaV2
```

2. Initialize a RecaptchaV2 object with a SeleniumBase Driver object:

```python
from seleniumbase import Driver

# Inicializa el objeto Driver
driver = Driver()

# Carga la p√°gina web
driver.get("https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/demo")

# Inicializa el objeto RecaptchaV2
recaptcha = RecaptchaV2(driver)

```

3. Use the cracker() method to resolve a reCAPTCHA on a web page:

```python
checked_status = recaptcha.cracker(selector='//*[@id="recaptcha-demo"]/div/div/iframe')
```

4. If the reCAPTCHA is successfully resolved, the method will return True. Otherwise, it will return False.

### Resolving text captchas

1. Import the necessary class to your Python script:

```python
from recaptcha_cracker import TextCaptcha
```

2. Initialize a TextCaptcha object:

```python
text_captcha = TextCaptcha(image_path='captcha.png', processing=True, kernel=(2, 2), verbose=True)
```

3. Use the `download_and_read_image` method to download and read a captcha image from a URL:

```python
captcha_text = text_captcha.download_and_read_image(url='https://example.com/captcha.png')
```

4. Use the `decode_and_read_image` method to decode and read a base64 encoded captcha image:

```python
base64_image = 'data:image/png;base64,...'
captcha_text = text_captcha.decode_and_read_image(base64_image=base64_image)
```

5. Use the `capture_and_read_image` method to capture and read a captcha image from a web page element:

```python
captcha_text = text_captcha.capture_and_read_image(driver, element='//img[@id="captcha_image"]')
```

6. The methods return the decoded captcha text if successful, or None if there was an error.
